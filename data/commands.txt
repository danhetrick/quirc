/ join [CHANNEL] [KEY]
Joins a channel. If the command is issued with no arguments, a dialog window will open ask for the channel (and channel key, if needed) to join. The channel key is only needed if the channel has the +k mode enabled.

/part CHANNEL
Leaves a channel.

/nick NEW_NICKNAME
Changes the user's nickname. All nicknames on a server are unique; if the chosen nickname is already taken, a random number is attached to the desired nickname, and that is set as the nickname.

/me MESSAGE
Sends a CTCP action message. These appear as action descriptions; for example, if your username was "funnygal", and you used the command "/me eats an apple", the message would appear to other IRC users as "funnygal eats an apple".

/msg TARGET MESSAGE
Sends a message to a user or channel.

/notice TARGET MESSAGE
Sends a notice to a user or channel.
