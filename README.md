# Quirc
A Python3/Qt5 IRC client. The latest version is **0.03001**.

**Quirc** is being actively developed.

## Requirements
**Quirc** requires Python 3, Twisted, and Qt5. Installing the requirements is as easy and opening a terminal and executing:

    pip install pyqt5
    pip install Twisted

If you want to use SSL to connect to IRC, pyOpenSSL and service_identity is also required:

    pip install pyOpenSSL
    pip install service_identity

If pyOpenSSL is not installed, SSL connections will not be possible; only commands to connect to normal, non-encrypted connections will be shown.

**Quirc** was written and tested under Windows, and should run in any other OS that supports Python 3, Qt5, and Twisted.

## Usage
**Quirc** was recently re-written, and features an all new GUI. This section will be updated when more documentation has been written.
